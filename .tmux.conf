# As of tmux 2.1, a backward-incompatible change was introduced.
# mode-mouse and mouse-* no longer exist, replaced by simply
# mouse <on|off>. Which is great, and easier, but unfortunately I use
# tmux on systems which I don't foresee going to 2.1+ anytime soon.
# So, time to test versions... this is kind of cheap and hacky, and it
# won't work for 2.2 and beyond, but will work for now. I tried to make
# this more generalized but have not been successful so far.
